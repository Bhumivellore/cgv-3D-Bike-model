# Bike 3D Model using OpenGL

This project is a simple 3D model of a bike created using OpenGL. The bike model includes various components such as the frame, wheels, pedals, handlebars, gas tank, and more. The bike can be controlled using the keyboard arrow keys for steering and speed.

## Requirements

- C/C++ compiler
- OpenGL library
- Glut library (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

## How to Build

1. Ensure that you have the required libraries installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Compile the project using the following command:

```
gcc -o bike_model bike_model.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm
```

## How to Run

1. After successful compilation, run the executable:

```
./bike_model
```

2. The bike model will be displayed in a new window.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the bike:
   - Up arrow: Increase speed
   - Down arrow: Decrease speed
   - Left arrow: Turn left
   - Right arrow: Turn right

## Controls

- Arrow keys: Steering and speed control

## Credits

This project was created as a demonstration of basic OpenGL concepts and 3D modeling. It is based on the original work by Bhumika vellore.
